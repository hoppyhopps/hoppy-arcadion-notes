Mechanics Break Down 
    Call Me Honey
        Shield and mitigate as needed

    She will open with any of the following combinations
        Drop of Venom + Tempting Twist
            Color pairs, out on intercardinals, stack together

        Drop of Venom + Beeline
            color pairs stack around the boss

        Splash of Venom + Tempting Twist
            Color pairs out on intercardinal away from each other

        Splash of Venom + Beeline
            Room for 4 melees around the boss, be in your clock position
            Ranged adjust farther from boss and away from each other

    And then follow with either of the two tank busters
        Killersting
            Tanks stack North and mitigate
        
        Stinging Slash
            Tanks must be top 2 in aggro, stance on early in opener
            Spread North away-ish from each other

============================================
= Major Mechanic 1, Honey B. Live: 1st Beat
============================================
    Honey B. Live, 1st Beat
        Heal and mitigate as necessary

    She will follow 'Honey B. Live, 1st Beat' with one of the two combos
        Outerstage Combo
            Start out on cardinals
            Stay out, move to intercardinals
            Move in, stay on intercardinals
        
        Centerstage Combo
            Start in on intercardinals
            Move out, stay on intercardinals
            Stay out, move to cardinals

        # a helpful trick to remember is that Centerstage does the opposite movement of Outerstage, and vice versa

    Love Me Tender
        Each player will start with a random number of hearts
            It seems like the number ranges between 0 and 2
        Ranged players prioritize towers farther from the boss
        Melee players prioritize towers nearer the boss
        Stop taking towers as soon as you've reached 3 hearts
            Whether you've soaked 1 tower or 3 is irrelevant

    Heartsick
        All players with 2 or fewer hearts should stack together
        This stack gives one heart, it must be taken while dodging hearts

    # important note for both Love Me Tender and Heartsick, you must avoid getting 4 hearts, it heals and buffs the boss

    She will follow up Love Me Tender and Heartsick with whichever combo she did not do to start this phase
        Outerstage Combo
            Start out on cardinals
            Stay out, move to intercardinals
            Move in, stay on intercardinals
        
        Centerstage Combo
            Start in on intercardinals
            Move out, stay on intercardinals
            Stay out, move to cardinals

    Honey B. Finale
        Heal and mitigate as necessary
        Signifies the end of Honey B. Live, 1st Beat

    Killersting
        Shared tankbuster

    Alarm Pheromones
        Baitable line aoes that come from the outside
        Stacking together can be beneficial to melees as it will lead to easier uptime
        This mechanic is kind of a fuck as far as I can tell, I'll search for a better guide

        Stacking together for this mechanic and rotating clockwise around the arena leads to a reasonable dodge pattern
        The only difficult part doing the mechanic this way is a 3-1 dodge that the players must perform towards the center of the arena

============================================
= Major Mechanic 2, Honey B. Live: 2nd Beat
============================================
    Honey B. Live: 2nd Beat
        Heavy raidwide aoe, heal and mit as necessary

    She will cast one of the following
        Drop of Love
            Delayed pair stack
            Beneficial to macro this in chat for later
            Comes back at the end of the mechanic

        Splash of Love
            Delayed spread
            Beneficial to macro this in chat for later
            Comes back at the end of the mechanic

    Love Me Tender 2
        0 Heart support starts North
        0 Heart DPS start South
        1 Heart players start mid under the boss

        Puddles + Stack
            0 Heart players rotate clockwise to dodge puddles
            Stack resolves after 3rd puddle

        AoE Markers + towers
            After stack resolves two players mid will receive AoE indicators
            Spread, supports north or west, dps south or east
            The remaining two 1 heart players take towers
            Tower priority is supports will take the north and west, dps the south and east
        
        Provided all mechanics were resolved properly, this leaves all players at 2 hearts

    Following this she will cast one of the following
        Tempting Twist
            donut aoe, then out on intercardinals
            resolve pair or spread

        Beeline
            in aoe, then in
            resolve pair or spread

    Honey B. Finale
        This indicates the end of Honey B. Live: 2nd Beat

    She will cast one of the following
        Splash of Venom
        Drop of Venom
        
        Remember to macro it in chat

    Alarm Pheromones
        Spawns bees that will cleave with big line aoes
        Set pattern for these, identify the lines and dodge them normally

    Poison Sting
        Targets 1 DPS and 1 support a time
        All other players will wait mid in her hitbox
        Supports will prioritize north and west for dropping puddles
        DPS will prioritize dropping south and east for puddles
        drop these at the edge of the arena
        At the end of the mechanic there will be a stack
        Supports stack west, dps stack east

    Stinging Slash
        Handle the same as the first one

    She will cast one of the following
        Tempting Twist
            donut aoe, then out on intercardinals
            resolve pair or spread

        Beeline
            in aoe, then in
            resolve pair or spread

============================================
= Major Mechanic 3, Honey B. Live: 3rd Beat
============================================
    Honey B. Live: 3rd Beat
        Heavy raidwide aoe, heal and mit as necessary

    Poison n Pop
        2 sets of debuffs, a short set (20s) and a long set (40s)
        all 4 dps will have the same debuff duration, as will all 4 supports
        resolve these debuffs at the wall in your clock position, as they are large defamations
        all other players wait mid

        Players who did not receive short debuffs will resolve the towers
        You take the tower near your color pair marker

        At the same time she will cast one of the following
            Drop of Love
                Delayed pair stack
                Beneficial to macro this in chat for later
                Comes back at the end of the mechanic

            Splash of Love
                Delayed spread
                Beneficial to macro this in chat for later
                Comes back at the end of the mechanic

        And the one of the following
            Outerstage Combo
                Start out on cardinals
                Stay out, move to intercardinals
                Move in, stay on intercardinals
            
            Centerstage Combo
                Start in on intercardinals
                Move out, stay on intercardinals
                Stay out, move to cardinals

        resolve all of these mechanics
        after center or outerstage combo short debuffs resolve, take at wall
        after short debuff resolves, long debuffs take towers

        After short debuff + towers she will cast the opposite combo
        afterwards resolve long defamations, short debuffs take towers

    She will cast one of the following
        Tempting Twist
            donut aoe, then out on intercardinals
            resolve pair or spread

        Beeline
            in aoe, then in
            resolve pair or spread

    Honey B. Finale
        raid wide aoe, indicates the end of Honey B. Live: 3rd Beat

    Rotten Heart + Call Me Honey (Soft Enrage)
        Nisi debuff, it must not be passed to anyone but your partner
        pre-position at clock spot
        Wait for each raid wide before popping the next set of debuffs
        11s debuffs gather mid then pop their debuffs
        Call Me Honey raid wide
        27s gathers mid and pops
        Call me Honey raid wide
        43s gathers mid and pops
        Call me Honey raid wide
        60s gathers mid and pops

    Video guide ends here, presumably enrage after
