        The 2 birds indicate where the towers will spawn
        They are looking at them

        long debuff players take towers
        look north and clockwise

        short debuffs do guns
        
        follow the same north and clockwise and northwest and ccw priority for gun players
        bait the guns *away* from towers

        The bait is precise, you must be as close to the gun that you're baiting as you can be
        You must also be as close to the wall as you can be

        2nd set of birds to indicate new towers and then
