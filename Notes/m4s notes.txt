        R1 R2
        MT OT
        M1 M2
        H1 H2

    Witch Hunt
        3 squares on the boss indicate baitable hunts
        Separated purple > far baits on opposite roles
        Close together purple > opposite role close bait

    Wide/Narrow Witch Hunt
        The name of the cast is what indicates what kind of mechanics it will be
        Wide Witch Hunt is Out In Out In
        Narrow Witch Hunt is In Out In Out

    Wicked Jolt
        Easiest to invuln probably

    Lightning Cage - No debuffs on the tip of the cocka

Mechanics Break Down
    Bewitching Flight
        Watch for the boss' cleave
        Watch for the side cubes' cleave
        Dodge both to pass the Mechanic

    Electrifying Witch Hunt
        Check position of side cubes
        Check which lines on the floor are electrified
        Mid will also be unsafe with the cleave from North
        Resolve on static quick march positions listed above

    Wide/Narrow Witch hunts
        Baiting the hunts is determined by the symbols
        Bait order can be done with HTMR

        Narrow Witch Hunt with Far Bait
        baiters need to stand near Markers
        Group needs to stand north of the C marker, being sure to be off it

        Wide Witch Hunt with Close Bait
        The inverse of Narrow Witch Hunt Far, naturally
        Baiters must be as close as possible to markers without being hit
        Group must sacrifice melee up time in favour of being farther south of C

        After you've completed your bait, head North to A (reduces confusion)

    Wrath of Zeus
        Shield + Heal as necessary

    Witchgleam
        Check YouTube reference at this time stamp for boss relative positions
        https://youtu.be/lIEETAuBazI?t=281
        M1 is under her, with M2 against the dangerous wall near them
        MT in front of M1
        OT in the same square, near corner of dangerous square that is tangential
        Odds are good we want Disco to be this tank as PLD can maintain uptime, where as others cannot
        putting me (VPR) there may be viable as well depending on uncoiled fury

        Witchgleam itself is 3 sets of 2 lasers that hit intercards (stay cardinal)
        Identify the corners that only got hit once
        Any corner hit twice will have entire quadrant explode
        Any corner hit once, only the farthest tile in that intercardinal will explode
        
    Wicked Jolt
        probably invuln this

    Witchgleam + Lightning Cage
        2 Charges -> 2 tile wide explosion
        3 Charges -> 3 tile wide explosion

        Long timers will always get a +1 due to a partner stack or spread
        Long debuff 1 -> 2
        Long debuff 2 -> 3

        Identify the new north by finding the tip of the dick/middle finger/eyebrows/whatever
        Supports with debuffs go West
        DPS with debuffs go East
        2 charges -> go closer to group in corner
        3 charges -> go far from group in corner

    Electrope Edge
        Check debuff duration -> 20s is short, 40s is long
        Count how many times your shot at
        short debuffs should be shot 2 or 3 times
        After identifying charge count, resolve thunder Cage

    Side Spark + Spread/stack
        Resolve these boss relative

    Electrope Edge (Long Debuff)
        Remember how many times you got shot, then add 1
        2 charges near safe spot, 3 charges far
        DPS relative East
        Supports relative West

    #Stage Destruction can be identified by going to the opposite side her targeting ring points at

    Electron Stream
        3 sets of blue/yellow lasers
        Stand in the opposite color of your debuff
        swap sides if needed
        Wild charge, so tanks must be in front

        Comes with a few debuffs
        blue debuffs, small point blank AoE and a donut
        Close and far cone debuffs (indicated by arrows + 2 people in icon)
        collider pink debuffs, which must be hit by cones

        DN strat
        Blue debuffs always stand to the sides
        Pink cones (arrow debuffs) always stand on her hitbox
        pink debuffs are always just behind cones

        Looks really easy with this strat actually??

    Wicked Jolt
        double swap buster, invuln it tbh
