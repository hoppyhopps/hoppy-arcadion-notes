    Witch Hunt
        3 squares on the boss indicate baitable hunts
        Separated purple > far baits on opposite roles
        Close together purple > opposite role close bait

    Wide/Narrow Witch Hunt
        The name of the cast is what indicates what kind of mechanics it will be
        Wide Witch Hunt is Out In Out In
        Narrow Witch Hunt is In Out In Out

    Wicked Jolt
        Easiest to invuln probably


Mechanics Break Down
    Bewitching Flight
        Watch for the boss' cleave
        Watch for the side cubes' cleave
        Dodge both to pass the Mechanic

    Electrifying Witch Hunt
        Check position of side cubes
        Check which lines on the floor are electrified
        Mid will also be unsafe with the cleave from North
        Resolve on static quick march positions listed above

    Wide/Narrow Witch hunts
        Baiting the hunts is determined by the symbols
        Bait order can be done with HTMR

        Narrow Witch Hunt with Far Bait
        baiters need to stand near Markers
        Group needs to stand north of the C marker, being sure to be off it

        Wide Witch Hunt with Close Bait
        The inverse of Narrow Witch Hunt Far, naturally
        Baiters must be as close as possible to markers without being hit
        Group must sacrifice melee up time in favour of being farther south of C

        After you've completed your bait, head North to A (reduces confusion)

    Wrath of Zeus
        Shield + Heal as necessary

    Witchgleam
        Check YouTube reference at this time stamp for boss relative positions
        https://youtu.be/lIEETAuBazI?t=281
        M1 is under her, with M2 against the dangerous wall near them
        MT in front of M1
        OT in the same square, near corner of dangerous square that is tangential
        Odds are good we want Disco to be this tank as PLD can maintain uptime, where as others cannot
        putting me (VPR) there may be viable as well depending on uncoiled fury

        Witchgleam itself is 3 sets of 2 lasers that hit intercards (stay cardinal)
        Identify the corners that only got hit once
        Any corner hit twice will have entire quadrant explode
        Any corner hit once, only the farthest tile in that intercardinal will explode
        
    Wicked Jolt
        probably invuln this
