Phase 1:

Markers
    Cardinals only
    A North
    B East
    C South
    D West

Mechanics
    Wrath of Zeus
        big shield + mit, hurts based

    Bewitching Flight
        Line cleave + cubes on left side of the arena
        Dodge cleave from her wings and cubes

    Electrifying Witch Hunt
        Lines from Bewitching Flight will begin to glow
        Either far outside dodge or inside lane dodge depending

        Spawns cubes on the opposite side of the arena which need to be dodged

        Hits 4 players (all supports or all dps) with a Witch Hunt
        The same players who are hit by Witch Hunt get a Forked Lightning Debuff
        
        Forked Lightning does nothing to the individual but can hurt players near them

    Witch Hunt
        Immediately after dodging Electrifying Witch Hunt
        She will begin to prepare another set of witch hunts indicated by an icon on her
        if 3 squares are close together (pink-ish), it will be baited on the 4 closest players
        If it is 3 squares farther apart (purple-ish) then it will be the 4 farthest players

        The players who were not hit by the first set of Witch Hunts will need to bait this set
        If your natural quickmarch position does not resolve this nicely, simply swap with your nearest dps
        IE, if Cat needs to be in, she moves up and trades places with me

    One of either: Widening Witch Hunt or Narrowing Witch Hunt
        Widening Witch Hunt starts with a point blank AoE (Out)
        Narrowing Witch Hunt starts with a donut AoE (In)

        During the cast bar she will also show the Close or Far icons
        Only need to pay attention to the first of these, as it will always alternate
        That is: if it is close first, it will be Close->Far->Close->Far
        and if it is far first, it will be Far->Close->Far->Close

        Resolution: DN strat
        Resolve it on the clock spot!
