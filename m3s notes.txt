        and vice versa
        Players will also receive fuses, 1 role short fuse
        and one role with long fuses
        that means if 1 dps has a long fuse, all dps have a long fuse
        and vice versa

        The goal is to send the short fuse players to stand on a long fuse bomb
        Ranged to the farther away intercardinal bombs (group 1 healer/ranged west, group 2 east)
        and the melees to the cardinal fuses (group 1 N/W and group 2 E/S)

        Long fuse players stand center on one of the 4 lines of the center diamond, away from short fuse bombs
        After fuses explode all player swap, long fuse players go to where short fuse bombs just exploded
        Short fuse players move from the long fuse bombs to the center, away from exploding bombs
